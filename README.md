# musical-improvisation-tool
#### *scale identifier. show which scales is possible depending on few notes. so you can enhance your solo plays on piano or guitar.*

## üé∏üéπ what is this?
a program to **identify musical scales** based on a few notes you play or hear. it helps you improvise fluently on **piano, guitar, or any melodic instrument** by quickly suggesting compatible scales and chords. *This is programmed with JavaScript, so anytone can access it through web-page.*

### one of my biggest joy is listening through my playlists and harmonize together with random songs. This program helps you to identify the key when you are playing with a random song.

for instance, *Sails of Charon by Scorpions* starts with:

1. C D E F# G A B C  
2. C# D E F# G A B C#
then, it continues with C.

confirming option (1): **B Phrygian**.

Now, you can play it really fast without trying to guess the notes and the scale within listening. Moreover, you know all the triad chords. If you do not, you can build up any chords you want to.

## Ô∏èüé∂üéπ Features

- Identify possible scales from a set of notes
- Suggest compatible triad chords
- Enhance improvisation and composing speed
- I am cooking the **JavaScript version**!
- **Java and Swift** versions coming soon!

### üéß Happy improvising!

# üéπüéµü™ó Basic Theory üé∏üéºüé∂
## WHAT IS CIRCLE OF FIFTHS?

Music theory is not a bunch of knowledge sent from heaven. Music is an observer of human history from the beginning of the creation. First times, there were percussions, wind instruments. Since the beginning of creation, music was not solely an art, but was also a science derived from nature. Musicians founded a relationship between the notes kept the audience focused to their music. For instance, we might not be able to explain it with the music theory. But our ears know that there is something "strange", something "unexpected", something "absurd" is happening when F and G is played with C#.

One of the first impulses we get from the outer world is heart beats of our mother when we were fetus :=) The birds harmonize together. The leaves harmonize with the wind. They all happen in harmony. This harmony in nature, what our ears are used to listen since the day we were a zygote, what is the tendency of the ears are documentated in the name of music theory.

Thus, even there were infinite counts of scales, notes in the ancient times, nowadays we are mostly knowledgable about major (Ionian) and minor (Aelonean) modes. Also, many instruments are in diatonic scale meaning there are no microtones in many instruments. 
Some have, for instance "baglama" has microtones but still not unlimited tones are available, it is restricted with frets.

All in all, this is not a memorized knowledge. It is documentation of human history and science. Order of sharps are: FCGDAEB and this is reversed for flat orders.

- C D E F# G A B (1#) 
- C# D E F# G A B (2#)
- C# D E F# G# A B (3#)
- C# D# E F# G# A B (4#)
- C# D# E F# G# A# B (5#)
- C# D# E# F# G# A# B (6#)
- C# D# E# F# G# A# B# (7#)

## INTERVALS:

- C D (WHOLE)
- E F(HALF)

#### W + H = Major Three 
#### H + W = Minor Three 
### Major Three + Minor Three = MAJOR Triad 
### (C-E-G) Minor Three + Major Three = MINOR Triad (E-G-B)

In piano, just slide hands.
On guitar, like Em barre.
Why it is called as Em barre? Because E note on the upper string is played open as 0. It is E2.
Touch any note through this string and imitate this shape)
CHORDS There is no certain knowledge for it. Triads are documentated but there are 5, 3 chrods. (Power?) there are suspended chords. (sus4, sus2) there are chords with four notes in it. (7) Build with any interval!

# üéπüéµü™óI am deeply in love with all kinds of music. I love music. üé∏üéºüé∂
Actually, I feel deeply sorrowful when someone asks me what my main instrument is. I literally play piano, guitar, bass, harmonica and ukulele. I even have a violin. Obviously, I am not a virtuoso - that is so true. But I am into philosophy of music, and to me, that is what really matters. 

When you listen to something - it can be birds singing, leaves rustling; you hear some noises. In the nature, if you lend an ear, you'll notice that they are perfectly in order. You don't feel anything abnormal. That's because music history developed upon the human ear, what was appealing to an ear over centuries evolved into what we call music today.

That is the reason we know seven modes. The most known is Ionian, major tone. For instance, Locrian mode is not feasible to the human ear, it disappeared through something similar to natural selection of music and time. Music is nature. Years after, these harmonies were documented under the name of "music theory". Bach, Vivaldi, Beethoven didn't follow these rules, they looked at the nature. They composed what would be appealing to compose, that's why they shaped music into an art from naturel harmonied noises. People documented their works later on.

When you listen to a music, it is bunch of notes in order. You hear D4, proceeding with a note that is higher in frequency. It might be something E? Higher? F? So, the story goes on. Once you have a prototype of the formula you hear, you can play it in anywhere.  Play the melody on harp, violin, harmonica, saxophone; it's you that decide. They are some vehicles, notebooks, compilers for music. 

The melody shows us the scale: which notes and chords goes on well together. You can harmonize it. You can modulate it, you can compose polyphonic components. 

Until now, I have taught music theory to ten of my friends. I even wrote a handwritten booklet for a person I love. Yet, I don‚Äôt have a music of my own. I noticed the same tragedy in my music teacher. He was such a perfect human being for the music world. But you know, he didn‚Äôt have an album. (Everyone who makes a boring rhythm on a table has an album, and he does not!)

The tragedy is similar to the "centipede" problem. While you ponder about which leg to step with, every other bug has already flown away.
