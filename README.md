## üé∏üéπ what is this?
a program to **identify musical scales** based on a few notes you play or hear. it helps you improvise fluently on **piano, guitar, or any melodic instrument** by quickly suggesting compatible scales and chords. *This is programmed with JavaScript, so anytone can access it through web-page.*

### one of my biggest joy is listening through my playlists and harmonize together with random songs. This program helps you to identify the key when you are playing with a random song.

for instance, *Sails of Charon by Scorpions* starts with:

1. C D E F# G A B C  
2. C# D E F# G A B C#

***then, it continues with C.***

confirming option (1): **B Phrygian**.

Now, you can play it really fast without trying to guess the notes and the scale within listening. Moreover, you know all the triad chords. If you do not, you can build up any chords you want to.

## Ô∏èüé∂üéπ Features

- Identify possible scales from a set of notes
- Suggest compatible triad chords
- Enhance improvisation and composing speed
- I am cooking the **JavaScript version**!
- **Java and Swift** versions coming soon!

## Ô∏èFor musicians or anyone who is willing to compose.

### üéß Happy improvising!
