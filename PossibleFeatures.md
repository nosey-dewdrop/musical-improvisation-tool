- identify melodies and turn them into something you can improvise to.
new octaves will be added.

- e5-g5-b5 is e minor.
yet g5-b5-e6 is also e minor but it is called "inversion" chord. they are not the same. if the highest note is counted as root, then the intervals are different. emotions are different.
actually it is why the musical analysis takes place to identify different modes. for instance, is is G major or E minor? or A dorian? 

even we see 11 octaves on piano, all instrumnents have this functionality.
that's why there is bass guitar for bass partitions and guitar for higher frequencies in orchestra.
